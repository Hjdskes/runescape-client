# Force Java to use pulseaudio, this can fix several sound related
# issues with the client (and the system if using Sun/Oracle Java)
# The final launch command will then be wrapped inside "padsp" so make sure that is installed!

# Force Java to use alsa, this is much more stable than forcing pulseaudio on OpenJDK and Sun/Oracle Java
# However you must have alsa and alsa-oss installed.
