This RuneScape client is put together by HikariKnight
to create a completely crossplatform RuneScape client that can be run
without installation on any platform, even platforms not supported by Jagex. 

I (Unia) just slimmed it down to match only my setup; Linux without Wine and no PulseAudio.
More features might be removed in the future.

The client files are from the Windows client for RuneScape.

The "RuneScape" perl script is written by HikariKnight, but is based on
Ethoxyethaan's shellscript to run the RuneScape Windows client natively.
